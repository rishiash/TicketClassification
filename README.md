## General Information
- Goal is create a model that can automatically classify customer complaints based on the products and services that the ticket mentions
- The following steps were executed - Data loading, Text preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Feature extraction
, Topic modelling, Model building using supervised learning, Model training and evaluation
- A Supervised model was created to predict any new complaints to relevant topics.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Following complaint topics were identified - Bank Account Services, Credit card or Prepaid card, Mortgage/Loan, Theft/Dispute Reporting, Other
- Raw data was cleaned up and converted into TF-IDF features.
- Topic Modelling was done using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Logistic Regression seems to be performing the best.
